# MXN442 Assignment 2- Project

## Description
Welcome to the GIT Hub set up to host the code, dataset, and report that collectively contribute to my submission of assignment 2 for MXN442 (Modern Statistical Computing Techniques) hosted by QUT (Queensland University of Technology). In this repo you will find: 1x R Script, 2x child folders containing 64 csv/xlsx files, 1x PDF, and this README.md.

## Installation
There are package dependencies which will need to be installed but an automatic installation has been coded into the script. The exception is the keras package which will require a python environment and tensorflow to be installed: see <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide> if the r script does not install this for you automatically

## Usage
This was an academic exercise to attempt to replicate the algorithm published by Ziel, F (DOI: 10.1109/OAJPE.2022.3160933). It has no endorsement for use in a live forecasting situation

## Dataset Information
All datasets were downloaded from <https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/day-ahead-electricity-demand-forecasting-post-covid-paradigm>. There is limited information on the origin of the data and beyond a hyperlink to email the author, little support. A benchmark code was provided but it can be considered a na√Øve forecasting model.

## Contact Information
For questions or feedback, you're welcome to contact [James Donovan] at [n9164090@qut.edu.au]. Please note a reply is unlikely for I'll have graduated :)))
